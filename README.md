# 👋 About Me

Welcome to my personal **Python Programming** repository!

I am **Sharik Ahmed**, a student specializing in **AI/ML**. I am passionate about leveraging Python's versatility to solve problems, automate tasks, and build efficient software solutions.

This repository serves as a central hub for my Python experiments, covering everything from basic scripting to Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) and data handling.

## 🚀 What's Inside?

This collection represents my continuous learning in Python. You will find code covering the following key areas:

### 🐍 Core Python
* **Fundamentals:** Syntax, Loops, Conditional Logic, and Input/Output operations.
* **Data Structures:** Mastering Lists, Tuples, Dictionaries, and Sets for efficient data storage.
* **Functions:** Writing modular code with arguments, return values, and recursion.

### 🏗️ Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
* **Classes & Objects:** Modeling real-world entities using Python classes.
* **Inheritance & Polymorphism:** Creating reusable and flexible code structures.
* **Encapsulation:** Protecting data and managing access within applications.

### ⚡ Logic & Automation
* **String Manipulation:** Advanced text processing and formatting.
* **File Handling:** Reading and writing data to text and CSV files.
* **Problem Solving:** Algorithmic solutions to common coding challenges.

## ✨ Highlights & Coding Standards

I strive to write **"Pythonic"** code that is clean, readable, and efficient. Here is what you can expect:

* **Readable Syntax:** Utilizing Python's clean syntax to write code that is easy to understand.
* **Modular Design:** Breaking down complex tasks into small, reusable functions and classes.
* **Documentation:** Clear comments and docstrings explaining the logic behind the code.
* **Error Handling:** Implementing `try-except` blocks to manage exceptions gracefully.

## 💻 Tech Stack & Tools

* **Language:** Python 3.x
* **IDE/Editor:** VS Code / PyCharm / Jupyter Notebook
* **Focus:** Automation, OOP, and Logic Building
